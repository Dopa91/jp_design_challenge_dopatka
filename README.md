# jp_design_challenge_dopatka

As part of a project, I was given the task of fully recreating a provided template. The goal was to accurately replicate the structure and functionality of the original,
focusing on achieving a precise reproduction.

This project allowed me to enhance my technical skills by working on the exact rebuild of an existing app.
I paid special attention to detail and technical execution throughout the process.

The result of my work is shown belowâ€”an exact replica of the template that meets both the functional and visual requirements of the original.
